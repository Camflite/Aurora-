## General Cleaning

For cleaning Aurora's exterior, it is recommended to use a gentle, non-abrasive cloth like a microfiber towel and a soap or detergent that is safe for plastic. The strength of the cleaning solution should be adjusted based on the amount of dirt or grime. Refer to the instructions below for more detailed guidance.

1. Water
2. Soap and water
3. General cleaner (like Simple Green)
4. Isopropyl Alcohol

To ensure Aurora's proper maintenance, it's best to steer clear of bleach and harsh solvents such as Acetone. In salt-rich surroundings, it's suggested to wipe Aurora down with a clean, damp cloth soaked in tap water..

## Preventative Maintenance Schedule

It is crucial to adhere to the preflight checklist to guarantee a secure and prosperous flight. Prior to takeoff, visually scrutinize the drone, controller, batteries, and payloads. Look out for any missing screws or hardware, any fresh damages or cracks, or anything that seems peculiar or different.&#x20;

This practice will help you identify potential issues before they pose a safety hazard during the flight. The Aurora drone has an impressive rating of up to 500 flight hours, and any component not mentioned in the preventative maintenance schedule is anticipated to endure for the drone's entire lifetime, including all electronics and motors.

### Every 15 Flights

Maintaining Aurora is hassle-free as it requires minimal upkeep. Apart from the daily motor checks enlisted in the checklist, ensuring the fasteners' tightness is the next crucial task. To verify the fasteners, use the hex drivers provided and apply the tightening torque to each fastener on the chassis. It's imperative to ensure that the fasteners don't slip.

{% hint style="info" %}
Use the tightening methods outlined in the "Replacing Components - Fastener Specifications" section if a fastener comes loose. Avoid applying more thread-locking compound unless the fastener has loosened multiple times.

#### Items that need tightness verified (ensure they have not worked loose):

* Motor mount bolts (attaches the motor mount to boom)
* Propeller Mount bolts (attaches props to motor)
* Prop Tension&#x20;
* Top and bottom chassis bolts
* Payload Isolation Mount
* Compass mounting bolts
* GPS antenna tightness
* Landing Gear bolts
* Any payload fasteners



### Every 15 Hours

**Inspect the following items. Replace if worn.**

* Propeller blades. Reject if chips, cracks, or deep scratches at visible
* Vibration Isolators: cracks, gel leaks, visible stretching
* Propeller blade washers (between blade and hub)

**Inspect all fasteners per the 15-flight interval requirements**

* Please ensure that the locking pin is not sticking or loose by performing a thorough inspection.
* Please inspect the play in the boom and verify if the rubber O-ring is intact. If it's loose, kindly address the issue.

**Landing Gear**

* Inspect that the clamp will properly clamp the carbon tube tight

**Motors**

* To check for any noise or roughness, rotate the motor manually.

### Every 200 Flight Hours

Perform the following actions:

* Replace the propeller mount assembly on each boom
* Send into Camflite for check-out
