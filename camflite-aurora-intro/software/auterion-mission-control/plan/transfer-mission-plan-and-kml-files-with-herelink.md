# Transfer Mission Plan and KML Files with Herelink

## Options for importing/exporting plans

* **Mission import/export:** AMC’s .plan files can be imported and exported. This is useful for creating missions on a computer and then importing them all to the Controller simultaneously.
*   **KML import:** KML files can be imported to AMC. This is useful for creating mission shape definitions in some software and then importing them all to Herelink simultaneously.&#x20;

    Important Note on importing:

    * Zoom in to the maximum level, then create a random survey shape. If you don’t zoom in, the survey shape could be very large and could crash AMC
    * Then click “import KML” on the right toolbar
    * The survey shape will automatically change to the data defined in the KML import
* **KML export:** This is useful for exporting waypoints outside AMC. You won’t be able to import them back as KML since these are waypoints and not a shape definition.
