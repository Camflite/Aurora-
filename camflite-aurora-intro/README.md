# Camflite Aurora Intro

Thank you for purchasing the Camflite Aurora; it is essential to thoroughly read and comprehend the manual, which provides a comprehensive overview of aircraft operation and flight control systems. However, it is crucial to note that this handbook cannot replace proper flight training. The specific training requirements may vary depending on the country or flight conditions. Therefore, it is always advisable to consult local regulations before piloting Aurora. In areas with no mandated flight training requirements, the pilot-in-command's sole responsibility is determining whether they possess the necessary training or experience for a particular flight. Establishing and adhering to personal minimums is imperative, ensuring you fly within your capabilities.
