# RTK GPS Mast Installation

You can find the RTK GPS inside a compartment provided in the case. Slide the RTK GPS mast onto the dovetail mount base at the UAS's front. A Pogo pin connection provides a solid connection to the RTK GPS to FMU.  The RTK GPS is an ARK RTK GPS using an F9P module.&#x20;

Make sure the thumb screw is backed out enough to allow the RTK GPS to slide in before tightening the thumb screw.
