The Aurora has four mounting points available for alternative landing gear systems. The lower plate is equipped with mounting locations for post-style landing gear with four points of attachment at the four corners, as shown in Figure 6. The process of installing the landing gear is straightforward: begin by opening the cam lock, then slide the gear into their respective holder and turn them 1/4 to locate them. Finally, tighten the screw to lock them in place.
