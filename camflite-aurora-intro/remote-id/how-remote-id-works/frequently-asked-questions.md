# Frequently Asked Questions

## How does Skynode broadcast the Remote ID?

Skynode is currently using WiFi beacon frames to broadcast the Remote ID Data. More details can be found on the page How [Remote ID works](https://docs.auterion.com/operators/settings-and-maintenance/remote-id/how-remote-id-works).

## Can Skynode's WiFi still be used alongside Remote ID?

Currently, it is not possible to use regular WiFi while Remote ID is enabled since Auterion then cannot guarantee that the message interval is strictly lower than 1s at all times.&#x20;

## Can Remote ID be disabled on Skynode?&#x20;

Only developers and manufacturers can temporarily disable Remote ID.&#x20;
