# Resgistering with the FAA

## Public DOC List

To ensure your Aurora drone (serial number) complies with Part 89 Remote ID regulations, you must have an FAA-accepted Declaration of Compliance (DOC) listed on the Public DOC List. This is in addition to meeting our Scope of Compliance. Without a listed [DOC](https://uasdoc.faa.gov/docs/RID000000241), you won't be able to register your drone with FAA Drone Zone.
