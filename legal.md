## Disclaimer and Warning&#x20;

\
Before using the Aurora, please carefully read this disclaimer and warning, and review the Aurora Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM). If you have any questions, please contact support@Camflite.com. You can find the most updated version of the manual on the Aurora Support Page.\
\
By using the Aurora, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to this disclaimer. You are solely responsible for your conduct while using the Aurora and for any direct or indirect consequences that may result from its use. Please comply with local and airspace rules and regulations and use the Aurora only for appropriate purposes.\
\
Please note that the Aurora is not a toy and must be operated with extreme care. Improper operation can cause damage to property, serious personal injury, or even death. As a complex and technical machine, novice pilots should take sufficient time to practice on a flight simulator and receive training from an experienced pilot before operating the Aurora. Please remember that the Aurora Aircraft Flight Manual and a flight simulator cannot replace training with an experienced pilot, especially when it comes to safely operating the Aurora. Novice pilots should never fly without the supervision of an experienced pilot.

Always thoroughly check the Aurora and its components before each operation. Maintain a safe distance from the Aurora when it is in use.

* Never attempt to touch the Aurora when the propellers are moving.
* Do not fly the Aurora over or around people, power lines, or other aircraft.
* Avoid using propellers that have visible imperfections or damage.
* Always keep children and animals at a safe distance from the Aurora when it is in use or when making changes to its configuration.
* Only use propellers provided by Camflite, specifically designed for use with the Aurora.

When updating Aurora's configuration, it is important to prioritize safety. To prevent accidental motor starts and resulting propeller strikes, always remove the propellers or power the Aurora with a low-power source. Before each flight, it is crucial to test the Aurora without the propellers to ensure that the motors are spinning in the correct direction and that the motor assignment corresponds with the Autopilot flight controller. Any motor direction or assignment inconsistencies can cause the Aurora to become uncontrollable and dangerous.\
As the operator, you are responsible for performing a thorough system check on the Aurora before every flight and learning how to operate it safely. Please follow all relevant rules and regulations to ensure safe and successful flights.

**Fly at your own risk.**

The Aurora is a tuned system with custom components chosen for each application. Modifying, removing, or substituting Aurora components will void the warranty and can lead to unsafe operating conditions.
