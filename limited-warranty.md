## Limited Warranty

Camflite, (“CFT”) LIMITED WARRANTY AND SERVICE POLICIES

## PART I – LIMITED WARRANTY

These CFT Warranty and Service Policies (“Policies”) apply exclusively to products purchased directly by end users from CFT or from CFT-authorized resellers (“CFT Product”). These policies do not extend to CFT distributors or resellers.\
\
By using your CFT Product, you agree to comply with these Policies. If you are not eligible or do not agree with any of the terms, please do not use your CFT Product. You may be eligible for a full refund of your purchase if you return the unused Product within seven (7) days, in accordance with Part III of these Policies.

## What is Covered

Under this Limited Warranty, CFT guarantees that each product you purchase will be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use, following CFT’s published product guidelines during the warranty period. CFT’s published materials include, but are not limited to, user manuals, safety guidelines, specifications, in-app notifications, and service communications.\
\
The warranty period for CFT Products and parts under the Inspired Flight brand is 12 months from the date of receipt. For CFT Products associated with other brands, such as integrated payloads and ground control systems, the warranty period corresponds to that of the respective manufacturer.

## How to Obtain Warranty Service

If a product does not work as promised during the warranty period, you can request service by contacting CFT through telephone, the website, the CFT Pilot’s Mobile App, or the Fleet Manager’s Tool. Please be aware that charges may apply for services not included in this Limited Warranty. Additionally, warranty service is only available in the specific CFT service regions where you purchased your CFT product.

## What CFT Will Do

CFT will work to diagnose and resolve your issue via telephone, email, or online chat. If necessary, CFT may ask you to download and install specific software updates. If your problem cannot be resolved through these methods, CFT will provide you with a Return Material Authorization (RMA) to send your CFT product to one of our repair facilities. You will initially be responsible for the shipping costs. However, if CFT determines that the issue is covered under this Limited Warranty, we will perform the necessary repairs at no charge to you and provide an account credit for the ground shipping costs from your location to our repair facility, which you can apply to a future purchase.

When you receive service, CFT is only responsible for loss or damage to your product while it is in CFT's possession or in transit, provided that CFT is responsible for the transportation. \
\
CFT is not liable for any loss or disclosure of data, including confidential, proprietary, or personal information contained within the product. \
\
In no event shall CFT, its affiliates, suppliers, resellers, or service providers be liable for any of the following, regardless of whether the claim is based on contract, warranty, negligence, strict liability, or any other legal theory, even if they have been informed of the potential for such claims and regardless of the failure of essential purposes of any remedies outlined herein:

1. &#x20;Third-party claims against you for damages
2. &#x20;Loss, damage or disclosure of your data
3. &#x20;Special, incidental, punitive, indirect or consequential damages, including but not limited to lost profits, business revenue, goodwill or anticipated savings

In no case shall the total liability of CFT, along with its affiliates, suppliers, resellers, or service providers, for damages of any kind exceed the amount of actual direct damages, which will not be more than the amount paid for the product. \
\
This limitation does not apply to damages resulting in bodily injury (including death), damage to real estate, or damage to tangible personal property for which CFT is legally responsible. \
\
Since some states or jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, this limitation may not be applicable to you.

If any warranties cannot be disclaimed, CFT limits the duration and remedies of such warranties to the length of this express warranty and, at CFT's discretion, may provide repair or replacement services as outlined in this limited warranty.\
