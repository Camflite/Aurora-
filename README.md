Please note that this manual is not meant to replace proper flight training. Different countries and flight conditions may have varying training requirements, so it's important to check local regulations before operating the Aurora. In regions without established training requirements, the pilot-in-command must determine if they possess sufficient training and experience for a particular flight. It's important to set personal minimums and only fly within your capabilities.
