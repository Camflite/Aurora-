# MavSDK

Aurora is equipped with Auterion Enterprise PX4 and is compatible with MavSDK. With a simple serial connection, one can retrieve GPS position and velocity messages from the autopilot and send commands for desired position or speed. For further information and example codes, visit DroneCode.org.&#x20;

MavSDK can be integrated into both mobile and onboard apps, allowing for the creation of remote controllers that communicate via MavLINK. Additionally, sensors can be configured to transmit data to and from Aurora using MavLINK. Lastly, by connecting to the herelink hotspot, one can gain full access to drone telemetry on a laptop via an app that runs on a PC.
