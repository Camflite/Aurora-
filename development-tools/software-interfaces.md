# Software Interfaces

Aurora is compatible with PX4 and MavSDK, allowing a serial connection to receive messages from the autopilot, such as GPS position and velocity, or send commands like position and speed. For more information, please visit [https://www.dronecode.org.](https://www.dronecode.org)&#x20;

Additionally, Aurora boasts an onboard computer that permits code to run in a Docker and connect via ethernet/serial to a payload, the autopilot, and the internet through an LTE modem. Further details can be found [HERE](https://docs.auterion.com/developers/getting-started/readme).
